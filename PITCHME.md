# Engineering vs. Sales
<h2 class="fragment">A Challenge Especially For Startups Negotiating With Enterprises</h2>

---

## Enterprises and Startups

The business world is mostly *owned* by enterprises but digitization opens up many opportunities:
- Startups want to change the world |
- Many startups have to negotiate with enterprises |
- Enterprises are notoriously hard to negotiate with |
- It takes many months and they have hard requirements |
- This creates a lot of pressure on the sales people |

Note:
8 out of 10 starups fail

I would say for the ones that negotiate with enterprises:
Out of 10 only 1 truely succeeds and one becomes a consulting company.

## Sales

Sales wants to sell to as many customers as possible.

Sales *owns* the customer requirements. They can always say:
- We won't get any new customers without this feature |
- It is hard or impossible to challenge this |
- So sales wants as many features as possible |

## Engineering

Engineering wants to develop a clean solution.

Engineering *owns* the technical solution. They can always say:
- This feature will be very expensive to implement |
- And maintenance cost will explode, too |
- It is hard or impossible to challenge this |
- So they want as few features as possible (that break their concepts) |

## Object Orientation

- It grew strong together with GUIs |
- Classes encapsulate functionality and state |
- Thus they decouple from other classes |
- OOP works best for purely technical domains |
- Inheritence creates a lot of coupling |
