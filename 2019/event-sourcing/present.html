        <h3>Downsides</h3>
        
  <ul>
  
    <li>Requires a lot hard to get or create tooling</li>
  
    <li>Next to <code>command</code> and <code>query</code> services also <code>projector</code> and <code>reactor</code> services</li>
  
    <li>Not one <code>query</code> service but many</li>
  
    <li>Quite a lot of complexity (easily many 100 services; or 3 to 10 times more than reasonable)</li>
