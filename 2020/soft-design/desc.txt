Microservices - The End of Software Design

In the old days we had only monoliths and the internal structure could vary.
That was the domain of software design but it often failed us and we got spaghetti code.
Modern microservices often contain only around 100 lines of business functionality and so software design is irrelevant.
Unfortunately the price for this is spaghetti architecture that is even harder to fight than spaghetti code.
This talks shows a middleway that avoids both pitfalls and introduces a tool for the Go programming language that helps to prevent spaghetti code.
