I am open for projects.


CQRS
====
- Split event store and message queue can be challenging to keep consistent.
- Extra processor (projector) for writing to the query store.


GDPR
====
- More serious infringements go against the very principles of the right to
  privacy and the right to be forgotten that are at the heart of the GDPR.
- Fine of up to €20 million, or 4% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue from
  the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher.
- If your annual worldwide revenue is more than €500M and you are always
  dwarfing your revenue from last year that is fine. :)

Don't use an event store that doesn't let you update or delete events.

Upsides
=======
- The scalability of CQRS is no magic built into the acronym.
- It simply comes from the possiblilty to use simpler, more scalable stores.
